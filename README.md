### Contents:

This repository contains a package for R that includes code and data used to analyse the spit depths and radiocarbon dates for the archaeological site Gua Mo'o hono, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Here's an overview of the key items in the package: 

In the /vignettes directory: 

One Rmarkdown file that can be executed in R. This files contains sections of the narrative found in the published paper and R code used to analyse the data, compute statistics, and generate the data visualisations and tables. To execute these files, ensure all the files are together in a directory in the same structure as they are in this repository, then open R and run `knitr::knit2html("XXX")` where XXX is the name of the Rmd, including the .Rmd suffix and the quotation marks. There are many dependencies on non-core R packages and other software, see the dependencies section below for more details.

One html file that contains the output produced by the code in the Rmarkdown file. These are what you should get if the Rmarkdown file executes properly.

Three csv files that contain the raw data on radiocarbon dates and spit depths. 

In the /R directory: 
 
Four R files containing code that the Rmarkdown file uses to load libraries, prepare radiocarbon dates for OxCal calibration, compute statistics, and manage dependencies. These files are sourced by the Rmarkdown file and are needed to execute the Rmarkdown file. The code is externalised in these R files purely as a convenience to improve the readability of the Rmarkdown file.

In the /inst/docs directory:

One html file that is the result of executing the Rmarkdown file. One R file that contains only the code from the Rmarkdown file, as well as the same Rmarkdown file as in /vignettes.

## Installation

The simplest way to access the code and data is to download the package in R using these lines:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bmarwick/PiperetalGMHBone")
library(PiperetalGMHBone)
```

Then you can execute the Rmarkdown file, running the code and generating the figures yourself, with this line:

```r
devtools::build_vignettes()
```

Or if you want to see the code and data without using R, download the [zip file](https://github.com/benmarwick/PiperetalGMHBone/zipball/master) You will find the pre-built vignette as a html file in the `/inst/docs` directory

### Dependencies:

I used [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (version 0.98.953) on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 and these packages:

Identified using sessionInfo():

 

All of these are included in this repository using [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/), a dependency management system that takes a snapshot of the libraries needed for this project and saves it in the project directory so that you can recreate those exact same libraries on another machine. To use this system, open the Rproj file in RStudio, then open the Rmd file and knit that. 

Other system dependencies identified using `dependencies::needs()` (https://github.com/ropensci/dependencies): 

- pandoc (>= 1.12.3) http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc
- jags (>= 3.0.0) http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/
- libcurl (version 7.14.0 or higher) http://curl.haxx.se

Note that these are external to R and are not bundled with this repository. You'll need to ensure they're installed yourself before executing the Rmarkdown file. Pandoc is installed when RStudio is installed.
